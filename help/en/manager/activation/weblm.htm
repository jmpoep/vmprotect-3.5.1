  <h1>Activation in Web License Manager</h1>

  <p>You can find the detailed Web License Manager description on <a href=
  "http://vmpsoft.com/products/web-license-manager/" target=
  "_blank">our website</a>, and here we merely provide minimum steps required to create an activation code for use with the Activation API.</p>

  <p>First, enter Web License Manager (you can use the demo on our website) and create a product. Then export the product as a VMProtect project to be able to configure licensing and activation. After the project is set up, all check are added to the code of your app and the executable is protected, click the "Add New Code" link on the left panel in WebLM:</p>
