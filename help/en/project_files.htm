  <h1>"Files" section</h1>

  <p>The "Files" section allows the developer to include to the protected EXE file additional data it requires for operation such as: images, data files, text resources and dynamically linked libraries. During execution of the protected EXE file, all types of data including DLL are loaded from memory of the process directly, bypassing writing of these data to the disk.</p>

  <p>The <strong>Add File</strong> toolbar button allows adding a new file to the project. You can also add a new file with the context menu:</p>

  <p>To adjust properties of the selected file, select it in the left list and edit its title, file name or properties.</p>
